# Saving The Sims (s1) - Tropy Database

Ever since I've become aware of the archiving efforts of the Saving The Sims archive, I've been quite thankful for the efforts by the community for preserving the files and putting them online for everyone to enjoy. Finding the right objects can become quite difficult when having to browse the threads inside of the forums, however. So I decided to give back to the community by creating this Tropy database, which aims to make browsing for the files a little easier!
